# TonFit
Fitton is a move-to-earn platform where users walk to earn tokens using NFTs that have limited health and expire with use.

#Abstract
Fitton is a Web3-based fitness platform that incentivizes physical activity through blockchain technology and NFTs. Users can participate by owning unique Fitton NFTs, each embedded with a finite "health" value representing their usable lifespan. By walking in the real world, users earn Fitton Tokens, creating a move-to-earn ecosystem that rewards healthy behavior. The NFT’s health decreases with use, encouraging consistent engagement while also introducing mechanics for scarcity and utility. Once an NFT’s health is depleted, it expires, prompting users to acquire new NFTs to continue participating. This system blends gamification, personal fitness, and digital asset ownership in a dynamic and rewarding way.
